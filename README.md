## Individual Sections
### Kevin's Section: 
* Feature Question: Does adding a link that describes what is being asked or answered affect score?
* Why: Whenever I am looking for answers online, the first answer I see does not always make sense to me so I find it helpful when another explanation or link is provided. This makes me want to know if this is true for all people.

```{r}
questions <- (read_csv("Questions_trunc.csv")) %>%
  select(-7)
answers <- (read_csv("Answers_trunc.csv")) %>%
  select(-7)
a <- questions %>%
  summarise(quantile(Score, 0.90))
#a = 41
b <- answers %>%
  summarise(quantile(Score, 0.90))
#b = 19

q_ind <- questions %>%
  mutate(link = str_detect(Body, "http:")) %>%
  mutate(s = case_when((Score>=41)~"high", ((Score<41)~"low")))
ggplot(data = q_ind) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(s)) +
  facet_wrap(~ link)

a_ind <- answers %>%
  mutate(link = str_detect(Body, "http:")) %>%
  mutate(s = case_when((Score>=19)~"high", ((Score<19)~"low")))
ggplot(data = a_ind) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(s)) +
  facet_wrap(~ link)
```

* Findings: For both questions and answers, if a link providing further explanation of the topic is included, the ratio of high scores to low scores increases. This means that there is a higher chance of a question or answer with a link to earn a higher score.
* Explanation: This finding can be explained by the fact that including a link provides the reader with a second interpretation of what is being described. This means it is more likely the reader will understand what is being said, thus leading to them giving an upvote.
